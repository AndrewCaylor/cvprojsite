<!-- Goal -->
<h3>Abstract</h3>

According to the American Automobile Association, pothole damage cost US drivers over $15
billion in damages over the last five years. Also, two-thirds of Americans are concerned with
potholes on their roads [2]. As self-driving cars become more prevalent, it might become
necessary for them to be programmed to avoid potholes in order to prevent damage to the vehicle
[1].
The goal of this project is to find the locations of potholes in an image, and then find the relative
location to the camera.

<!-- Introduction -->
<h3>Introduction</h3>
Motivation behind the problem you are solving, what applications it has, any brief background on the particular domain you are working in (if not regular RBG photographs), etc. If you are using a new way to solve an existing problem, briefly mention and describe the existing approaches and tell us how your approach is new.

<br><br>
<!-- Approach -->
<h3>Approach</h3>
Describe very clearly and systematically your approach to solve the problem. Tell us exactly what existing implementations you used to build your system. Tell us what obstacles you faced and how you addressed them. Justify any design choices or judgment calls you made in your approach.

<br><br>
<!-- Results -->
<h3>Experiments and results</h3>
Provide details about the experimental set up (number of images/videos, number of datasets you experimented with, train/test split if you used machine learning algorithms, etc.). Describe the evaluation metrics you used to evaluate how well your approach is working. Include clear figures and tables, as well as illustrative qualitative examples if appropriate. Be sure to include obvious baselines to see if your approach is doing better than a naive approach (e.g. for classification accuracy, how well would a classifier do that made random decisions?). Also discuss any parameters of your algorithms, and tell us how you set the values of those parameters. You can also show us how the performance varies as you change those parameter values. Be sure to discuss any trends you see in your results, and explain why these trends make sense. Are the results as expected? Why?

<!-- Results -->
<h3>Qualitative results</h3>
Show several visual examples of inputs/outputs of your system (success cases and failures) that help us better understand your approach.
